**Teacher Digital Competencies in 2026: Over 661,000 Certified Educators**

<br>

The year 2026 marks a historic milestone in Spanish teacher training. With more than 661,366 teachers already certified in digital competencies, Spain has exceeded Plan DigEdu's goal of reaching 80% certification of teachers in publicly funded centers. This transformation is not just a number; it is a silent revolution that is changing how teaching and learning happens in Spanish classrooms.

<br>

**The Framework of Reference for Teacher Digital Competency**

<br>

The Framework of Reference for Teacher Digital Competency, updated in 2022 and aligned with the European #DigCompEdu framework, establishes the competencies teachers must master in the digital age. This framework is not limited to basic use of technological tools; it encompasses six fundamental areas that transform teaching practice.

The first area, **Information and information literacy**, trains teachers to search, evaluate, manage and share digital information critically and effectively. In a world saturated with information, this competency is essential to help students navigate the digital environment safely and productively.

The second area, **Communication and collaboration**, prepares teachers to communicate efficiently through digital media, collaborate in virtual environments and participate in online professional communities. This competency is crucial in a world where education transcends classroom walls.

The third area, **Digital content creation**, empowers teachers to create, edit and share quality digital educational resources. From educational videos to interactive presentations, certified teachers can create materials that significantly enrich the learning experience.

The fourth area, **Security**, ensures teachers protect both their own information and that of their students, understand digital risks and promote safe and responsible technology use. In an era of growing concerns about digital privacy and security, this competency is more important than ever.

The fifth area, **Problem solving**, trains teachers to identify technological needs, solve technical problems and use technology innovatively to improve teaching and learning.

The sixth area, **Evaluation and continuous improvement**, allows teachers to reflect on their digital practice, evaluate the effectiveness of technologies used and continuously adapt to new tools and methodologies.

<br>

**More than 24,470 training actions developed**

<br>

The certification of more than 661,000 teachers has not been accidental. Behind this achievement is a massive training effort: more than 24,470 training actions developed throughout Spain, covering from basic competencies to advanced specializations.

These training actions are not traditional theoretical courses. They are practical programs that include:

- In-person and online workshops on specific digital tools
- Collaborative projects where teachers apply what they've learned
- Communities of practice where they share experiences and best practices
- Progressive certifications that recognize different competency levels
- Continuous training that adapts to emerging new technologies

The diversity of these training actions ensures that each teacher finds the type of training that best fits their needs, starting level and specific educational context.

<br>

**Impact on daily teaching practice**

<br>

Digital competency certification is transforming daily teaching practice in tangible and measurable ways. Certified teachers are using technology more effectively, creating richer learning experiences and personalizing education in ways that were previously impossible.

In classrooms, we are seeing:

- Use of adaptive learning platforms that adjust to each student's pace
- Creation of interactive multimedia content that increases student engagement
- More fluid communication with students and families through digital channels
- Real-time formative assessment that allows immediate adjustments in teaching
- Collaboration between teachers and centers through digital platforms

These changes are not superficial; they are significantly improving educational outcomes. Recent studies show that students in classrooms with highly digitally competent teachers show better academic performance, greater engagement and better digital skills.

<br>

**Learning personalization thanks to digital competency**

<br>

One of the most significant transformations that teacher digital competency brings is the ability to personalize learning on a scale that was previously impossible. Certified teachers can use educational data analysis tools to identify individual needs of each student.

Modern school management systems, integrated with learning platforms, allow teachers to:

- Identify students who need additional support before they fall behind
- Adapt content and teaching pace to specific needs of each student
- Automatically provide additional resources when difficulties are detected
- Celebrate individual achievements in a more visible and motivating way

This personalization not only improves academic outcomes; it also increases student motivation and reduces frustration, creating a more positive and productive learning environment.

<br>

**Improved communication with families**

<br>

Teacher digital competency is also transforming communication with families. Certified teachers can efficiently use digital communication platforms, mobile applications and notification systems to keep families informed and engaged.

This improved communication includes:

- Real-time updates on student academic progress
- Instant notifications about events, assignments and important dates
- Secure sharing of photos and videos of school activities
- Bidirectional communication that allows families to ask questions and receive quick answers
- Access to educational resources families can use at home

The result is a 60% increase in family satisfaction and greater parent engagement in their children's education, which in turn improves educational outcomes.

<br>

**Integration of new pedagogical methodologies**

<br>

Digital competency is not just about using technology; it's about integrating it in a pedagogically sound way. Certified teachers are adopting innovative methodologies that leverage technology's power:

- **Digital project-based learning**: Students work on collaborative projects using digital tools
- **Flipped classroom**: Students consume content at home and work on practical activities in the classroom
- **Educational gamification**: Use of game elements to increase motivation and engagement
- **Augmented and virtual reality**: Immersive experiences that enrich learning
- **Microlearning**: Educational content in short and accessible formats

These methodologies, when implemented by digitally competent teachers, are transforming the educational experience and better preparing students for the digital world of the 21st century.

<br>

**Challenges and opportunities for educational centers**

<br>

Although the massive teacher certification is an extraordinary achievement, it also presents challenges and opportunities for educational centers. Centers must ensure they have the necessary technological infrastructure so certified teachers can apply their competencies.

This includes:

- Modern and comprehensive school management systems
- Integrated learning platforms
- Digital communication tools with families
- Adequate devices and connectivity
- Continuous technical support

Centers investing in these technologies are seeing extraordinary returns: more satisfied teachers, more engaged students, more involved families and better overall educational outcomes.

<br>

**The role of school management systems**

<br>

Modern school management systems are essential for certified teachers to fully apply their digital competencies. A comprehensive platform like Edena provides all the tools teachers need:

- **Data analysis**: Insights on student performance and teaching effectiveness

When certified teachers have access to these tools, they can maximize the impact of their digital competencies and truly transform the educational experience.

<br>

**Continuous training and constant evolution**

<br>

Digital competency is not a destination; it is a continuous journey. Educational technologies constantly evolve, and teachers must stay updated. Centers investing in continuous training are ensuring their teachers remain leaders in educational innovation.

This continuous training includes:

- Updates on new tools and platforms
- Training in emerging pedagogical methodologies
