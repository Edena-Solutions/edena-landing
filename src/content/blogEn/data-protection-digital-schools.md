# Data Protection in Digital School Management: A Practical Guide for Leaders

Digital management of an educational center involves processing data on students, families, and staff. Data protection in the digital school is not optional: it is a legal obligation and a condition for trust. This guide summarizes responsibilities, risks, and practical measures for leaders.

## Why Data Protection in the Digital School Is a Priority

Educational centers are responsible for the personal data they process (records, billing, communication, attendance). Non-compliance with GDPR and local data protection laws can lead to fines, complaints, and reputational damage. Data protection in the digital school must be built into provider selection, internal processes, and staff training.

### What Data a Center Processes and Who Is Responsible

Academic, health (where applicable), financial (payments), communication, and employee data are involved. The data controller is usually the center’s legal owner (foundation, company). Software providers that process data on behalf of the center are processors and must offer contractual and technical guarantees.

## How to Ensure Data Protection in the Digital School

### 1. Legal Basis and Transparency

Each processing activity must have a legal basis (contract performance, legal obligation, consent where required). Families and staff must receive clear information on what data is collected, for what purpose, and for how long. Data protection in the digital school starts by documenting processing and keeping privacy notices up to date.

### 2. Choosing Providers (Processors)

When contracting management, billing, or communication software, require the provider to act as a processor, with a contract covering confidentiality, security measures, subprocessing, and support for data subject rights. Data protection in the digital school means checking that hosting and data are in the EEA or in countries with an adequate level of protection.

### 3. Technical and Organizational Measures

Restricted access by role, strong passwords, encryption in transit and at rest where appropriate, and planned backups. Organizationally: staff training, device use policy, and a procedure for security breaches. Data protection in the digital school should be reflected in a record of processing activities and periodic reviews.

### 4. Data Subject Rights

Families and students (or their representatives) can exercise access, rectification, erasure, restriction, and portability. The center must respond within the legal timeframe and have a clear channel (email, form) for requests. Data protection in the digital school includes documenting how these rights are handled.

### 5. Retention and Deletion

Do not keep data longer than necessary. Define retention periods by type of data (academic, billing, communications) according to sector and employment law. Data protection in the digital school requires clear deletion or anonymization criteria when the purpose has ended.

## Practical Cases: Data Protection in the Digital School

A school reviewed its contracts with its management and communication software; they added processor annexes and verified server location. Another center drew up a processing table (enrollment, billing, canteen, absences) and assigned internal owners; when a family requested erasure of data for a student who had left, they could carry it out consistently across all systems.

## Common Mistakes in Data Protection in the Digital School

- Signing contracts with providers without processor clauses.
- Not informing families about processing or using generic consents without clear purposes.
- Storing data on personal devices or non-corporate clouds without security measures.
- Having no procedure for breaches (notification to the supervisory authority and affected individuals within the required time).
- Keeping data indefinitely “just in case” without retention criteria.

## Actionable Checklist: Data Protection in the Digital School

1. Create or update the record of processing activities (what data, purpose, legal basis, retention).
2. Review contracts with software providers: processor role, data location, subprocessors.
3. Publish or provide clear information to families and staff on processing (privacy notices).
4. Define retention periods by type of data and procedure for deletion or anonymization.
5. Set up a channel and owner for handling rights (access, rectification, erasure, etc.).
6. Train staff on good practices and the breach procedure.
7. Review the record and processor contracts at least once a year.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Who is the data controller in an educational center?**  
Usually the center’s legal owner. Leaders act on their behalf; software providers are processors.

**Must data be on servers in the EU?**  
Not always mandatory, but it is the simplest way to comply with GDPR. If the provider uses third countries, there must be safeguards (standard clauses, adequacy decisions).

**What to do if there is a data breach?**  
Assess the risk to those affected; if there is a risk, notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours and, where applicable, inform the individuals. A written procedure speeds up the response.

**Can families ask us to delete all data about their child?**  
They have the right to erasure when data is no longer necessary (e.g. after leaving the center and once the legal retention period has passed). There are exceptions (legal obligations); document your criteria and retention period.

**Does data protection in the digital school require a DPO?**  
Not always. It is mandatory for public bodies and for large-scale or special-category processing. Many private centers are not required to appoint one but assign an internal lead to coordinate; it is good practice.

## Conclusion

Data protection in the digital school is the center’s responsibility and must be part of governance, provider relations, and daily operations. Documenting processing, requiring guarantees from processors, and training staff reduces risk and strengthens family trust.

**Summary in 5 key points:**

1. The center is the controller; software providers are processors and must offer guarantees.
2. Families and staff must be informed and legal bases and purposes documented.
3. Processor contracts and data location (EEA preferred) are essential.
4. Define retention, a channel for rights, and a breach procedure.
5. Review the record and contracts at least once a year.
